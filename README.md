# My way

My way is a voice output communication aid (VOCA). It turns your computer, tablet or smartphone into a bespoke speech output device. It is a versatile, easy and fun way to record, arrange and play back audio streams. You can trigger playback of recordings via mouse, touch screen, keyboard and switches.

# Features

The following ways of sequencing playback are supported:

- Sequence: record a series of messages, which are then played in order from first to last. For example, you can record the segments of a story and have the user progress through them on step at a time.
- Random: recordings are played in a random order. For example, you can make make audio dice.
- Shuffle: recordings are shuffled. For example, you can decide the order in which students complete an activity in a classroom setting.
- Scan and prompt: two switches are assigned roles of 'scan' (progress through a sequence of recordings, playing them at low volume) and 'prompt' (play the last recording played via 'scan' at full volume). For example, you can record a series of personalized greetings, pick the one to use with the scan switch, then play it at full volume using the prompt switch.
- Converse: two switches are assigned roles of 'converse A' and 'converse B'. Recordings are played in sequence alternating A, B, A, B, ... (they take it in turns, so, if the same button is pressed twice in a row, nothing is played the second time).
